It had a annotation feature, however, its limited in functionality. And, in practice, it's limited to just a couple of words. ShowNote CLI App bridges that gap by adding note-taking functionality to TW. It's desinged to communicate over the API so that it's decoupled in functionality and friction is minimum.",
