The app is providing integration between sales office and the cargo company Kolay Gelsin. Kolay Gelsin is young and rapidly growing cargo company in Turkey. They are mostly known for their latest deal with Amazon. Because both companies are relatively young, bigger e-commerce integration companies are still to adopt them to the their ecosystem. This opens up an opportunity window for freelancers like me.",

This project helped the company to streamline their product and stocks management. They are receiving products from a number of different suppliers. Managing those products and stocks without an integration system is difficult. With this project I eased up that pain. Also I created an integration system with fullfilllment center, which helped eradicating a lot of error prone, time consuming manual work.",

It had a annotation feature, however, its limited in functionality. And, in practice, it's limited to just a couple of words. ShowNote CLI App bridges that gap by adding note-taking functionality to TW. It's desinged to communicate over the API so that it's decoupled in functionality and friction is minimum.",
