# manifest.json errors

While working with react when you start a project with Create React App you can get that strange error:

```
Parsing application manifest
http://localhost:3000/manifest.json:
The manifest is not valid JSON data`
```

It’s really not clear what it’s referring to. You check your manifest.json file at the root and nothing’s wrong with it. So, what’s going on.

It turns out that, for some reason linking between the actual manifest.json file and index.html file is broken. You have to fix the link to fix the problem. Here is how:

Go to your `index.html` file at public/index.html

Find the section that links the manifest. It should be something like that:

```
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"/>
```

or

```
<link rel=“manifest” href=“%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json” />
```

Change the href to:

```
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json"/>
```

Basically, delete any proceeding slashes and you should be good to go.
