# You should put Content type at the top of you html

_cs/blog_

When html file trying to decode whatever in the file, it has 2 options to
successfully accomplish this. One is getting the encoding type from the header
file. if that’s not present then use the a herustic to decide to encoding. It’s
kind of expensive but works well most of the time.

What happens when browser loads the html file. It went through the file to find
out the encoding and once it finds out the encoding, it circles back to
beginning and starts to interpret the html with that encoding.

What happens if there is no encoding then it uses the heuristics to guess the
encoding and then re-interprets the html with that guessed-encoding type. Most
of the time it works but there are times when it fails. So the best approach
should be to but encoding type in the html file.

One performance trick that you might guess from previous section is to put the
encoding at the top of the header. The earlier the browser reads in the encoding
the earlier it stops searching. This means better performance and no loosing
time to start working on the actual code.
