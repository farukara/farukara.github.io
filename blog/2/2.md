# manifest.json errors
While working on react app if you started the project with Create React App you can get this strange error says : 

```“Parsing application manifest http://localhost:3000/manifest.json: The manifest is not valid JSON data.”``` 

It’s really not clear what it’s referring to. You check your manifest.json file at the root and nothing’s wrong with it. So, what’s going on. 

It turns out for some reason linking between the actual manifest.json file and you index.html file is broken. You have fix that to get rid of that problem. Here is how:

Go to your ```index.html``` file at public/index.html

Find the section that links the manifest. It should be something like that:
```
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"/>
```
or
```
<link rel=“manifest” href=“%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json” />
```

which ever it’s you need to change the href to: 
```
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json"/>
```
Basically, get rid of any proceeding slashes or any other crap and you should be good to go.
